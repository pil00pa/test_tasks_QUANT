# Task 1: Natural Language Processing - Named Entity Recognition (NER)

- In this directory, there is a file named `task1.ipynb`, which contains all the data preprocessing steps, model training, and an example of Named Entity Recognition (NER).
- Additionally, there are two Python files:
  - `model_training.py`, which is a copy of the training code from `task1.ipynb`.
  - `model_inference.py`, which is a copy of the code used to demonstrate the model's inference. For this script to work in this directory, a folder containing the model weights named `trained_distilbert_ner` must be present. The model weights are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d0Q4f0zV7pJcC-8JuLjCJxw_KcpJpx_5?usp=sharing).
- For this task, I used the DistilBERT model, which I trained on a dataset generated with the help of ChatGPT.
- The necessary libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file located in the task-1 directory.
- A detailed discussion of the dataset and model can be found in `task1.ipynb` and the accompanying PDF report.
